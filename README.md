# cdf_cpp

## Build as a regular CMake project:
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
make
```

## As an example with Qt visualization, run:
```
./persistent ../maps/test/frontier_test_1.map ../patterns/patterns_30_30.txt
```

More details on build and run instructions as well as information on generating pattern files in progress.
In the meantime, I am available at tushark@cmu.edu for urgent questions.
